# TIC TAC TOE ❌⭕

## Introduction 📋
The goal of this project is to recreate the classic arcade game TIC TAC TOE. The game is designed for two players, taking turns to place their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to align three of your symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does. This implementation focuses on delivering an intuitive user interface and smooth gameplay experience.

## Game Features 🎮
- **Two-player mode**: Players can challenge each other locally on the same machine.
- **Visual Interface**: The game is visually interactive, allowing players to click on the grid to place their symbols.
- **Win Detection**: The system automatically checks for wins and ties after each move, and announces the result at the end of the game.

## Technologies Used 💻
- **Python**: The primary programming language used to build the game logic and handle the overall functionality.
- **Pygame**: A Python library used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) and manage player interactions, allowing for smooth animations and real-time updates.

## Future Improvements 🚀
In the future, the project could be extended with additional features like:
- **AI Opponent**: Adding a single-player mode where the player can challenge an AI with different difficulty levels.
- **Online Multiplayer**: Implementing a networked version so players can compete against each other remotely.
